        "api_key": "you-api-key", 
        "companies": [
            {
                "name": "Company 1",
                "filters": {
                    "domain_name": [],
                    "ip_address": ["127.0.0.1"],
                    "host_name": ["localhost"],
                    "asset_value": [],
                    "severity": ["critical", "high"],
                    "priority": [],
                    "hosting_provider": [],
                    "country_name": []
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Company 2",
                "filters": {
                    "ip_address": ["0.0.0.0"]
                }
            }
        
        ],
        "filters": {
            "domain_name": [],
            "ip_address": [],
            "host_name": [],
            "asset_value": [],
            "severity": ["critical"],
            "priority": [],
            "hosting_provider": [],
            "country_name": []
        }
    }


* More than one company finding list can be queried with it's own set of filters. Company 1 shows all available fitlers, while Company 2 shows that empty filters need not be present. 
* To query all companies in your Risk Recon instance, simple remove the "companies" field entirely. 
* If the "companies" field is not present, and filtering is still requested, the "filters" field can be used to filter all findings across all companies. It carries the same behavior as the company filters. The "filters" field is disregarded in the prescense of the "companies" field.
* Removing both fields will allow retrieval of all findings in the Risk Recon instance.

**Massive Resources, Learning Paths, and Collection for DevSecOps**

Inspired by the awesome-\* trend on GitHub. This is a collection of documents, presentations, videos, training materials, tools, services, and general leadership that support the DevSecOps mission. These are the essential building blocks and tidbits that can help you to arrange for a DevSecOps experiment or to help you build out your own DevSecOps program and anything you need, **all learning paths**.

We intend for it to be an awesome list that grows and changes as the community learns and improves how DevSecOps is implemented and adopted. To be included in this list, the information, tools, vendors, or initiative must provide for Free or Open Source capabilities that help with the DevSecOps mission. Links that lead to a commercial aspect are noted with a (P).

Information

We-ve been working across the industry to learn more about the different types of DevOps + Security initiatives. This collection has been pulled together and includes Podcasts, Videos, Presentations, and other Media to help you learn more about DevSecOps, SecDevOps, DevOpsSec, and/or DevOps + Security.

Guidelines

While we-re not into the paper way of doing things, sharing sound advice and good recommendations can make software stronger. We aim to make these guidelines better through code.

Vulnerable Test Targets

It-s important to build up knowledge by learning how to break applications left vulnerable by security mistakes. This section contains a list of vulnerable apps that can be deployed to learn what not to do. These same apps can be made safe by remediating the intentional vulnerabilities to learn how to prevent attackers from gaining access to underlying infrastructure or data.
