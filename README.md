Inspired by the awesome-\* trend on GitHub. This is a collection of documents, presentations, videos, training materials, tools, services, and general leadership that support the DevSecOps mission. These are the essential building blocks and tidbits that can help you to arrange for a DevSecOps experiment or to help you build out your own DevSecOps program and anything you need, **all learning paths**.

We intend for it to be an awesome list that grows and changes as the community learns and improves how DevSecOps is implemented and adopted. To be included in this list, the information, tools, vendors, or initiative must provide for Free or Open Source capabilities that help with the DevSecOps mission. Links that lead to a commercial aspect are noted with a (P).

Training

DevSecOps requires an appetite for learning and agility to quickly acquire new skills. We-ve collected these links to help you learn how to do DevSecOps with us.

Labs

Labs are hands-on learning opportunities to grow your skills in Dev, Sec, and Ops. All skills are useful and need to be grown so that you can have the empathy, knowledge, and trade to operate the DevSecOps style.

Vulnerable Test Targets

It-s important to build up knowledge by learning how to break applications left vulnerable by security mistakes. This section contains a list of vulnerable apps that can be deployed to learn what not to do. These same apps can be made safe by remediating the intentional vulnerabilities to learn how to prevent attackers from gaining access to underlying infrastructure or data.
